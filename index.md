Set Dances is a practice tool for Irish dancers.  It provides the music for all the traditional and championship set dances approved by the Irish Dance Commission (An Coimisiun le Rinci Gaelacha) for use in solo Irish dance competitions.  This app allows the music to be adjusted to a wide range of speeds.

The music tracks were made in sync with a computer metronome, and the indicated speeds have been checked for accuracy against a stopwatch and other calibrated timing sources.

Features:

- Built for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV
- All music is built into the app
- Includes the music for the 8 traditional set dances
- Contains the music for more than 35 championship set dances
- Includes An Coimisiún set dance tunes: "The Vanishing Lake" and "The Charlady"
- Includes set dance tunes used by Comhdháil Na Múinteoirí Le Rincí Gaelacha (An Comhdháil): "The Donegal Rambler", "Planxty Irwin", and "The Battle of Arklow"
